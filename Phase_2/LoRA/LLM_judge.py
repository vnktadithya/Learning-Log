Your job is to evaluate the root cause and the recommended action and produce an output in the strict JSON format with exactly two keys.No preamble. No markdown code blocks. No backticks. No conversational filler.
	
OUTPUT FORMAT:
{{
 "reasoning" : ".....",
 "score" : an integer value
}}

where:
1) 'score': rate it on a scale of 5
2) 'reasoning': 1-sentence technical justification for the score.
			
Follow the instructions to provide the score:

Score = 1: Complete failure. The model hallucinated the entire root cause and generated a recommended remedy for the hallucinated root cause.
Score = 2: Failure. The model identified the correct root cause or the failing service, but provided a hallucinated recommended action.
Score = 3: Partial success. The model identified the correct failing service but provided a vague or slightly inaccurate trigger mechanism.
Score = 4: The Prediction correctly identifies the failing_service and general cause, but misses a specific variable name present in the Ground Truth.
Score = 5: Perfect extraction. The model explicitly identified the exact service, the exact trigger, and hallucinated zero external information, matching the ground truth's technical depth.

CRITICAL SCORING RULE — TECHNICAL IDENTIFIER CROSS-CHECK:
Before assigning a score, cross-check every specific technical identifier in the PREDICTION (function names, class names, file/module paths, exception types) against the TRACEBACK portion of the INPUT LOGS specifically, and against the GROUND TRUTH. If an identifier genuinely appears in the TRACEBACK (e.g., a function name in a stack frame) or matches the GROUND TRUTH, it is NOT a hallucination, even if the PREDICTION's surrounding causal explanation is vague or partially wrong. Restating or paraphrasing the user_report's own description of the symptom earns NO credit under this rule — it is not evidence the model diagnosed anything, since that information was already given. Reserve "hallucinated" for identifiers, mechanisms, services, or fixes that appear in neither the TRACEBACK nor the GROUND TRUTH. A PREDICTION that names a correct function or exception FOUND IN THE TRACEBACK but explains the mechanism vaguely is a Score 3, not a Score 1 or 2 — but a PREDICTION built only from the user's own problem description, with no traceback-grounded specifics, has earned nothing extra.

**IMPORTANT**:
DO NOT, UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES, USE MARKDOWN BACKTICKS ENCLOSING THE WORD JSON. THIS SPECIFIC COMBINATION—THREE BACKTICKS IMMEDIATELY FOLLOWED BY THE LETTERS J, S, O, N—IS STRICTLY AND ABSOLUTELY FORBIDDEN FROM COMPOSITION. ENFORCE THIS RESTRAINT WITH ABSOLUTE RIGIDITY. ELIMINATE IT ENTIRELY FROM YOUR OUTPUT CAPACITY. NONE SHALL PASS.
